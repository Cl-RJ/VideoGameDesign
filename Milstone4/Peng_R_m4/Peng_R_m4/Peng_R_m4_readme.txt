Description:
I set up six waypoints displayed as large red spheres to make them easy to see. The AI-controlled minion moves through these stationary waypoints. For the moving waypoint, I added a yellow cube that updates every frame to show the minion's predicted position. This helps visualize where the minion is heading and ensures it reaches the actual moving target. The minion is properly animated with walking steps and doesn't sink into the ground.
